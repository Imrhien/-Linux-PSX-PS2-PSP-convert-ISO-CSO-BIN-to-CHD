# PSX PS2 PSP: convert ISO/CSO/BIN to CHD on Linux
A script that uses CISO and CHDMAN to convert your libraries to CHD format. Automatically installs dependencies (apt/pacman/dnf depending on distro). I built this for myself and decided to expand it for other users to try :) 

Usage:

Place ISO_CSO_to_CHD.sh in your ROM folder. Then in terminal, make the file executable and then run.
```
chmod +x ISO_CSO_to_CHD.sh
./ISO_CSO_to_CHD.sh
```
